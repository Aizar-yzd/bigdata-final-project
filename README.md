# Big-Data---Airbnb Data Processing
This repository contains a Big Data processing pipeline for managing and transforming Airbnb property data.
The project focuses on building a structured, automated, and scalable data pipeline using ETL and ELT approaches to transform raw data into clean, standardized, and analysis-ready datasets.

The pipeline covers the complete lifecycle of Big Data processing, including data ingestion, cleaning, standardization, aggregation, feature engineering, and data enrichment for analytical and machine learning purposes.

## Project Objectives
- Design a Big Data processing pipeline for Airbnb property data
- Handle data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats
- Implement ETL and ELT pipelines using Python and SQL
- Perform data aggregation and feature engineering to enrich datasets
- Produce analysis-ready datasets suitable for dashboards and machine learning
